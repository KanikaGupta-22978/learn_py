'''
A function start with a def keyword
Followed by the name of the function and then a paranthesis containing the list of arguments
Arguments can be blank also
Function can return a value also

A function is like the maths one

    y = f(x1,x2,..)
    
    y is the return value
    f is the name of function and 
    x is the argument
'''


# def message():
#     print("Hello Kanika Mam, plz leave my hair and ear")

'''
Name of the function: message
Arguments: 
return: 
To run the functin we simply call it with the arguments
'''
# print("The function is called below")
# message()


'''
To pass argument simply put them in paranthesis
    y = f(x)
'''

# def add(a,b,c):
#     print(a+b+c)

# add("I"," was ","late")

'''
We don't always have to print
We can take the output as return
'''

def matrix(a,b,c,d):
    return a*d-b*c

r1 = matrix(5,7,8,9)
r2 = matrix(1,2,3,4)
print(r1,r2)
